In this case, I will analyze the given data sets in order to gain a greater understanding on how compensation is affected by social factors such as gender, education, and job satisfaction. \n\nThis is a multivariate problem that is affected by the interaction of many features and is based on a large international survey. The questions answered during this analysis should shed some light on gender disparity issues, as well as disparities in other areas such as in age and in between countries. In order to compare compensations between countries for this analysis, I will use a file to convert all foreign currencies to the US dollar.\n\nThe files containing the data being analyzed are:\n\n<ul>\n  \n  <li>survey_responses.csv: Contains about 17,000 answers from all around the world</li>\n  \n  <li>conversion2dollar.csv: Contains conversion rates to the US dollar </li>\n</ul>"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"92167221-8d6f-42e2-a16a-6d7cfdf10c7e","inputWidgets":{},"title":""}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### 1.

the above table there are some interesting statistics to take note of. The largest gender disparity exists in the Czech Republic with 94% of the participants from the Czech Republic being male, and 6% of the participants being female. The least disparity in Gender belongs to Ireland, Malaysia, and the Philippines, with the split in gender being 68% male and 32% female for Ireland, 68% male, 30% female and 1% different identity for Malaysia, and 68% Male, 26% female, and 6% nonbinary for the Philippines. Besides the Unmentioned countries, the Philippines had the largest percentage of nonbinary people at 6% while Finland and Argentina had the largest percentage of people with a different identity. Overall, the biggest takeaway from this analysis is the Male gender group outnumbers every other gender group combined by a staggering amount. It is important to note that survey involves people with jobs in STEM fields such as Computer Scientists, Engineers, Statisticians etc. This indicates that there are more males than other gender groups in these types of jobs internationally and that there is a global gender disparity."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"b8372a62-bf08-41c9-a80b-df7ef7fed8f7","inputWidgets":{},"title":""}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### 3.

table above shows that there is a disparity between countries concerning salary for these types of STEM field jobs in particular. Based off the results from this analysis, the best country to work in with one of these types of jobs is the United States with a median salary of $105,000, with Switzerland coming in second with a median salary of $104,338. The worst country for someone to work in with one of these types of jobs based solely on median salary is Nigeria with a median salary of $1,812 and then Egypt coming in second with a median salary of $4,380. It is shocking to see the United States median salary is over 50 times more than Nigeria's median salary. These results may be partially due to the cost of living in these countries. Overall however, if someone held one of these types of jobs and worked in countries such as Nigeria or Egypt, it would benefit them greatly by taking their experience and working in other countries with a higher median salary instead such as the United States or Switzerland."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"e9a0c95f-dc6e-4d2e-adb6-de4524550faf","inputWidgets":{},"title":""}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#Conclusion\nIn conclusion, based off the results from this analysis I have shown disparities in not only gender, but also in age, job, and country. \n\nHere are some of the key statistics from each of the analyzations I performed:\n\nWhen analyzing gender split among the participants by country I found that each and every country had the male gender group outnumber all the other gender groups combined. This showed that jobs in the STEM field have a disproportionate amount of males compared to other genders internationally.\n    \nWhen analyzing differences in average and median salary among the different gender groups I found the male gender groups earned significantly more on average than females and nonbinaries as well as having a higher median salary than these gender groups as well. People with a different identity had both the highest average and median salary however this could be attributed to the lack of data for this gender group since there were only 27 rows with this specific gender.\n\nWhen analyzing disparity in age concerning salary I found that salary and age have a positive relationship with each other, with a correlation of approximately .11. This means that as age increases, salary is likely to increase as well. I also created a table which showed the average salary per decade and found this to be true as well, as the average salary increased for each decade up until the 40s where it starts to decrease slightly. I found the average salary to peak for people in their 70s with an average salary of $190,000 although this is most likely the result of an outlier. The lowest average salary was for people in their 10s with an average salary of $50,000.\n\nWhen looking for the job with the highest median salary I found that to be the Operations Research Practitioner with a median salary of $106,921. I also found the job with the lowest median salary to be a programmer with a median salary of $23,753. This analysis was useful because all the different salaries for jobs in these STEM fields. For example, for jobs concerning data, Data Scientist had the highest median salary of $68,343 while Data Miner had the lowest median salary with $36,547. Therefore based off the results from this data, it would benefit the Data Miner to use their experience to try to get a job as a Data Scientist.\n\nIn my final analysis I looked for disparities between countries concerning salary. I found the countries with the highest median salary to be the United States and Switzerland, with median salaries of $105,000 and $104,338 respectively. On the other hand, I found the countries with the lowest median salary to be Nigeria with $1,812 and Egypt with $4,380. Out of all the disparities I analyzed, I found the most shocking one to be that the United States had a median salary over 50 times larger than Nigeria. Thus, it can be deduced from the results of the analysis that it would be very beneficial to people who work in Nigeria, Egypt or any other country with a low median salary to use their experience in countries with a higher median salary such as in the United States or Switzerland. \n\nTherefore, I have shown and proven disparities in gender, age, job, and country concerning these types of jobs in the STEM field. Some of these disparities are warranted such as disparities in age concerning salary since age is an indicator of experience so the more experience one person has, naturally the higher their salary should be. However, other disparities are not warranted such as disparities in gender concerning salary, the fact that males outnumber all other gender groups internationally, and median salaries in some countries being many times more than median salaries in other countries. Efforts should be made to invite other gender groups to come into these types of fields and increase the salary for these gender groups as well. Efforts should also be made to increase salaries in countries with a low median salary such as in Nigeria or Egypt."],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"48d1d83a-ce5a-46d0-99c8-b8b258fa886e","inputWidgets":{},"title":""}}}],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+notebook":{"notebookName":"Analyzing Gender Disparity","dashboards":[],"notebookMetadata":{"pythonIndentUnit":4,"mostRecentlyExecutedCommandWithImplicitDF":{"commandId":198329492622875,"dataframes":["_sqldf"]}},"language":"python","widgets":{},"notebookOrigID":2871412284426144}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
