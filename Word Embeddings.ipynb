       " 'the american journal of cardiology. the effect of vagus nerve stimulation on ventricular excitability was studied in 28 dogs under various conditions of adrenergic neural tone. strength-interval curves were delineated from the apex of the right ventricular endocardium with a transvenous bipolar catheter. vagus nerve stimulation in both closed chest and open chest dogs shifted the strength-interval curve 6 to 8 msec later into electrical diastole (p less than 0.001). left stellate ganglion stimulation shifted the strength-interval curve 9 to 11 msec earlier into diastole (p less than 0.001). the effect of simultaneous left stellate ganglion and vagus nerve stimulation was not significantly different from that of left stellate ganglion stimulation alone. the influence of vagus nerve stimulation on the strength-interval curve under basal conditions was abolished by acute beta adrenergic blockade with propranolol. it is concluded that vagus nerve stimulation affects ventricular excitability as well as vulnerability by opposing the effects of sympathetic neural tone.',\n",

       " 'the journal of biological chemistry. properties of glutamine-dependent glutamate synthase have been investigated using homogeneous enzyme from escherichia coli k-12. in contrast to results with enzyme from e. coli strain b (miller, r. e., and stadtman, e. r. (1972) j. biol. chem. 247, 7407-7419), this enzyme catalyzes nh3-dependent glutamate synthase activity. selective inactivation of glutamine-dependent activity was obtained by treatment with the glutamine analog. l-2-amino-4-oxo-5-chloropentanoic acid (chloroketone). inactivation by chloroketone exhibited saturation kinetics; glutamine reduced the rate of inactivation and exhibited competitive kinetics. iodoacetamide, other alpha-halocarbonyl compounds, and sulfhydryl reagents gave similar selective inactivation of glutamine-dependent activity. saturation kinetics were not obtained for inactivation by iodoacetamide but protection by glutamine exhibited competitive kinetics. the stoichiometry for alkylation by chloroketone and iodoacetamide was approximately 1 residue per protomer of molecular weight approximately 188,000. the single residue alkylated with iodo [1-14c]acetamide was identified as cysteine by isolation of s-carboxymethylcysteine. this active site cysteine is in the large subunit of molecular weight approximately 153,000. the active site cysteine was sensitive to oxidation by h2o2 generated by autooxidation of reduced flavin and resulted in selective inactivation of glutamine-dependent enzyme activity. similar to other glutamine amidotransferases, glutamate synthase exhibits glutaminase activity. glutaminase activity is dependent upon the functional integrity of the active site cysteine but is not wholly dependent upon the flavin and non-heme iron. collectively, these results demonstrate that glutamate synthase is similar to other glutamine amidotransferases with respect to distinct sites for glutamine and nh3 utilization and in the obligatory function of an active site cysteine residue for glutamine utilization.',\n",
       " 'journal of pharmaceutical sciences. experiments were carried out to determine the effect of urea and creatinine on the solubility of nitrofurantoin in water at different temperature and ph conditions. the addition of urea to aqueous media increased nitrofurantoin solubility up to a maximum concentration level and then decreased solubility at higher urea concentrations. the amount of urea needed to bring about maximum nitrofurantoin solubility was dependent on temperature and ranged between 1.75 and 2.50%. spectral studies suggest a possible interaction between urea and nitrofurantoin molecules. nitrofurantoin solubility increased with an increasing creatinine concentration ranging from 0.05 to 1.6%. spectral studies indicate a strong interaction between creatinine and nitrofurantoin molecules in solution. the combined effect of urea and creatinine of the solubility of nitrofurantoin could account for the absence of crystalluria with this drug, even though unusually high concentrations in urine have been reported.',\n",
       " 'biochimica et biophysica acta. levels of reduced and oxidized triphosphopyridine nucleotides have been determined in reconstituted spinach chloroplasts and compared with levels in whole isolated chloroplasts during photosynthesis and darkness. the ratio of nadph/nadp+ reaches values slightly above 1.0 at the beginning of photosynthesis, less than half the ratio attained with whole chloroplasts. nonetheless these lower ratios are sufficient to maintain high rates of photosynthetic carbon dioxide fixation and reduction, which are comparable in the reconstituted chloroplasts to the rates found with whole chloroplasts. as with whole chloroplasts there is a decline in the ration of nadph/nadp+ as a function of time of photosynthesis. the effect of addition of bicarbonate (6 mm) in causing a transient drop in the ratio of nadph/nadp/ is described and discussed in terms of the reversibility of the reduction of 3-phosphoglycerate to triose phosphate. the ratio nadph/nadp+ can be improved by the addition of more lamellae either before or during the course of photosynthesis, and this improvement in ratio is accompanied by an improved rate of co2 fixation or a more sustained rate of co2 fixation with time of photosynthesis. the importance of nadph/nadp+ ratio not only to the reduction of 3-phosphoglycerate to triose phosphate but also to the activation of the ribulose-1,5-diphosphate carboxylasemediated step is discussed.',\n",

[3h]na uptake in whole cns was almost unchanged, despite the marked regional variations. the results have been interpreted as being due to a 'pruning effect', where the permanent na denervation in distant nerve terminal projections (e.g. cerebral cortex) leads to a compensatory sprouting and increased outgrowth of na terminal projections in areas close to the perikarya (e.g. pons-medulla). furthermore, the results support the view that the growing locus coeruleus neurones are strictly programmed to produce a certain quantity of nerve terminal volume and arborization during the postnatal development.\",\n",

(2) during the second and subsequent illuminations first-order (exponential) kinetics were observed for the formation of i-. this is due to the dark decay, k4, to the state diq2-fe2+ formed after the first illumination. (3) removal of the quinone resulted in first-order kinetics. in this case, only the first step, k1, is operative. (4) the observation of the doublet signal in reaction centers containing menaquinone but not ubiquinone is explained by the longer lifetime of the doublet species i-(q-fe2%) in reaction centers containing menaquinone. the value of tau2 was determined from kinetic measurements to be 0.01 s for ubiquinone and 4 s for menaquinone (t = 20 degrees c). the temperature and ph dependence of the dark electron transfer reaction i-(q-fe2+) yields i(q2-fe2+) was studied in detail. the activation energy for this process was found to be 0.42 ev for reaction centers containing ubiquinone and 0.67 ev for reaction centers with menaquinone. the activation energy and the doublet splitting were used to calculate the rate of electron transfer from i- to mq-fe2+ using hopfield's theory for thermally activated electron tunneling. the calculated rate agrees well with the experimentally determined rate which provides support for electron tunneling as the mechanism for electron transfer in this reaction. using the epr doublet splitting and the activation energy for electron transfer, the tunneling matrix element was calculated to be 10(-3) ev. from this value the distance between i- and mq- was estimated to be 7.5--10 a.\",\n",

       " 'journal of immunology (baltimore, md. : 1950). adoptive transfer of spleen cells or spleen cell lysates from mice tolerant to human-gamma-globulin (hgg) specifically suppressed the response of normal syngeneic recipients to hgg. the suppressive activity could be transferred for over 100 days after tolerance induction. the suppression induced by both spleen cells and spleen cell lysate was found to be specific as evidenced by a normal response to a challenge with turkey-gamma-globulin or goat erythrocytes. the activity of the suppressive lysate could be removed by passing the material through an hgg immunoadsorbent column but not by passing it through an anti-hgg column or a bsa column. these results indicated that the factor had antigen specificity and was probably not antigen-antibody complexes. that this suppression was not due to a shifting of the kinetics of the antibody response has also been demonstrated. the antigen-specific suppressor factor in the tolerant spleen cell lysates was a protein with a m.w. of approximately 45,000 daltons. the kinetics of the appearance of both suppressor cells and suppressor factor were consistent with a mechanism of active suppression functioning in the maintenance of tolerance to hgg.',\n",

       " 'the journal of experimental medicine. in order to analyze the genetic and physiological basis of controls affecting the generation of the repertoire of antigen-binding cells in fetal mice, we have measured the numbers of spleen cells specific for each of four antigens as a function of the total numbers of nucleated and ig-bearing cells in inbred, hybrid, and random bred fetuses. for each of the two inbred strains balb/c and cba/j, the proportion of nucleated cells specific for a given antigen was the same for all individuals of the strain at the 18th day of gestation. the proportion did vary from antigen to antigen, however, and for each antigen the proportion of specific cells observed in cba/j fetuses was approximately four times that observed in balb/c fetuses. this difference appeared to be due to a difference between the two strains in the relative size of the repertoire of antigen-binding spleen cells at this stage of development, inasmuch as the frequency of ig-bearing spleen cells in cba/j fetuses was likewise approximately four times that observed in balb/c fetuses. in random bred swiss-l fetal mice at the 18th day of gestation, the proportion of cells specific for a given antigen varied significantly from one individual to the next. the ratio of proportions of the two antigens observed was constant from individual to individual, however, and this constant ratio differed significantly from the ratio observed for the same two antigens in fetal balb/c and cba/j inbred mice. these data suggest that the ontogeny of the repertoire of antigen-binding cells in fetal mice is subject to at least two independent sets of controls, one affecting the relative size of the repertoire in the spleen, and the other affecting the distribution of antigen-binding specificities within that repertoire. analysis of repertoire size and composition in the spleens of hybrid fetuses confirmed the observation that the two parameters are controlled independently, and suggested further that the control of repertoire size in these fetuses is due to the action of one or a few closely-linked autosomal mendelian genes. these data are consistent with models for the origin of antibody diversity in which the genes coding for the full repertoire of antibodies are generated somatically from a small number of germ-line genes early in development and in the absence of any strong positive or negative selection with respect to antigenic specificity.',\n",

       " 'the journal of clinical investigation. hepatic plasma membranes prepared from rats rendered diabetic by streptozotocin bound approximately twice as much insulin per 50 mug protein as control membranes. glucagon binding of diabetic and control membranes was virtually identical. this increased insulin binding was not due to a nonspecific effect of streptozotocin, decreased degradation of insulin slower dissociation from its receptor, or a selective higher yield of membranes prepared from the diabetic livers. diabetic and control membranes both showed negative cooperativity. scatchard analysis suggested that the difference in binding was due to an enhanced binding capacity of the diabetic membranes rather than increased affinity of the binding sites. increased insulin binding of diabetic membranes was returned to normal by insulin treatment. these data are consistent with the postulate that there is an inverse relationship between circulating insulin levels and insulin binding and that insulin may modulate its own receptor. however, since it has been reported that fat, muscle, and hepatic tissue from rats made diabetic by alloxan administration are insensitive to insulin, the capacity for binding can not be the sole factor determining the response to insulin in diabetes mellitus. therefore, sensitivity of the diabetic liver to insulin is determined, at least in part, by events subsequent to the binding of insulin to its receptor.',\n",

(b) the activity depression was removed by addition of urea or bay papain-digestion, but not by addition of p-chloromercuribenzoate. (c) in the kcl concentration where the activity depression occurred, the atpase reaction proceeded in two distinct phases; the activity was relatively high in the early phase of the reaction and declined into the later phase where the steady state reaction took place. (d) in the kcl concentrations higher than that particular concentration or in the presence of urea, the atpase reaction proceeded in one phase. (e) the temperature dependence of the atpase activity in the early phase was of an ordinary magnitude being approximately equal to that of the atpase activity in 0.6 m kcl. in contrast, the temperature dependence of the activity in the later phase was unusually small. gizzard myosin in various concentrations of kcl was also examined by measuring the turbidity and the light-scattering intensity, and by observation under an electron microscope. the following was thus found: (a) in the kcl concentration where the activity depression occurred, there was a stagnation in the turbidity decrease as the kcl concentration was gradually increased and also the formation of \"thick filaments,\" each of which was approximately 0.6-0.9 micron in length and 20-30 nm in diameter with no central \"bare zone.\" (b) addition of atp induced dissociation of the thick filaments, and the dissociation occurred during the early phase of the atpaseeaction. (c) moreover, the temperature dependence of the atp-induced dissociation rate was approximately equal to that of the atpase activity in the early phase. on the basis of the findings mentioned above, it is concluded that the activity depression results from the atp-induced dissociation of myosin filaments. moreover, since high concentrations of kcl or urea also caused dissociation of myosin filaments and yet did not produce the activity depression, it was strongly suggested that gizzard myosin in the atp-dissociated form must be different from that in the urea- or kcl-dissociated form, probably in the physical state of some myosin aggregates which were not detectable by the physical methods we used. as a side-observation, gizzard myosin filaments formed in the presence of adp were found to be unusually long (longer than 2 micron), and they looked very similar to the particular filaments of skeletal myosin that were reported, by moos, to be formed in the absence of the c protein.',\n",

       " \"biochemistry. the kinetics of the increase in protein fluorescence following the addition of atp to subfragment-1 (sf-1) and acto-sf-1 have been reinvestigated. the concentration dependence of the rate obtained with sf-1 did not fit a hyperbola and at high atp concentration, approximately 40% of the signal amplitude was lost due to a fast phase at the beginning of the transient (20 degrees c). at lower temperature (less than or equal to 10 degrees c) the fluorescence transient was biphasic, with a fast phase observed at high atp concentration. these results indicate that there are two steps in the sf-1 pathway in which there is a change in protein fluorescence. measurements of atp binding and hydrolysis by chemical quench-flow methods indicate that the rate of atp binding is correlated with the fast fluorescence step and hydrolysis is correlated with the slow fluorescence change. the sf-1 mechanism can thus be described as: (formula: see text) where m represents sf-1 and states of enhanced fluorescence are given by m (16%) and m (36% enhancement, relative to sf-1). step 1 is a rapid equilibrium with k1 approximately 10(3) m-1. tight binding of atp occurs in step 2 and the loss of signal amplitude requires k2 greater than or approximately 1500--2000 s-1. the maximum observed fluorescence rate defines the rate of hydrolysis, k3 + k-3 = 125 s-1 (20 degrees c, 0.1 m kcl, ph 7.0). the steps in the mechanism correspond to the bagshaw--trentham scheme, with the important difference that the assignment of rate constant is altered. formation of the acto-sf-1 complex gave a fluorescence enhancement of approximately 14% relative to sf-1. dissociation of acto-sf-1 by atp produced a 20--22% enhancement in fluorescence. there was no detectable fluorescence change during dissociation as evidenced by a lag in the fluorescence transient which corresponded to the kinetics of dissociation. the fluorescence change occurred at the same maximum rate as for sf-1 but there was no loss in signal amplitude at high atp concentration. the kinetics of the fluorescence change corresponded to the rate of atp hydrolysis, whereas tight atp binding occurred at a much faster rate in approximate agreement with the rate of dissociation. thus the fluorescence change in the acto-sf-1 pathway corresponds to step 3 in the sf-1 mechanism. the complete scheme can be described as follows: (formula: see text) where am represents acto-sf-1. the tight binding step in the sf-1 pathway (k2) is sufficiently fast so that a similar step (k2') in the acto-sf-1 pathway could precede dissociation but the am-atp intermediate has not been detected. following hydrolysis on the free sf-1, actin recombines with m.adp.pi or possibly with a second sf-1 product intermediate as proposed by chock et al.

       " 'journal of immunology (baltimore, md. : 1950). polystyrene latex particles (plp) and zymosan particles (zp), two commonly employed phagocytic stimuli, were noted to bind to purified human peripheral blood lymphocytes. this interaction was not accompained by ingestion but did lead to a marked increase in intracellular cyclic amp. the camp response to plp was proportional to the particle cell ratio which, in turn, correlated with the number of membrane-associated particles. after the addition of plp to lymphocytes, the camp response occurred within 2 min, peaked between 4 and 15 min, and returned to baseline by 30 to 60 min. the camp response to zp was similar in onset and duration to that seen with plp but was less marked (2- to 4-fold vs 25- to 50-fold) and more variable in magnitude. this is probably a reflection of the smaller number of cells interacting with zp. at high plp to cell ratios almost all of the lymphocytes bound plp but only 10 to 28% of the mixed lymphocyte population bound zp. two lines of evidence established conclusively that the camp response was taking place in the lymphocytes themselves rather than in contaminating cells. 1) when lymphocytes were purified additionally by filtration through a nylon wool column (99 to 100% lymphocytes), they were found to undergo a similar camp response to plp. since the nylon filtration procedure also removes almost all of the b cells, this further indicates that t cells are capable of undergoing the response. 2) immunofluorescence studies with anti-camp antibody revealed an increase in intralymphocytic camp which was primarily adjacent to the site of plp or zp attachment. the likely explanation of this data is that plp and zp perturb the lymphocyte surface leading to regional activation of membrane-bound adenylate cyclase and subsequent camp accumulation. although the physiologic significance of these observations remains to be determined, the results: 1) provide histologic confirmation for the concept of camp compartmentablization, 2) clarify conflicting results regarding the localization of camp accumulation during the phagocytosis of plp by mixed leukocyte populations, and 3) suggest that this experimental system may allow an analysis of the mechanism by which perturbations of the lymphocyte surface modulate camp.',\n",

       " 'the journal of membrane biology. the influence of vibrio cholerae enterotoxin (choleragen) on the response of adenylate cyclase to hormones and gtp, and on the binding of 125i-labeled glucagon to membranes, has been examined primarily in rat adipocytes, but also in guinea pig ileal mucosa and rat liver. incubation of fat cells with choleragen converts adenylate cyclase to a gtp-responsive state; (-)-isoproterenol has a similar effect when added directly to membranes. choleragen also increases by two- to fivefold the apparent affinity of (-)-isoproterenol, acth, glucagon, and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide for the activation of adenylate cyclase. this effect on vasoactive intestinal polypeptide action is also seen with the enzyme of guinea pig ileal mucosa; the toxin-induced sensitivity to vip may be relevant in the pathogenesis of cholera diarrhea. the apparent affinity of binding of 125i-labeled glucagon is increased about 1.5- to twofold in choleragen-treated liver and fat cell membranes. the effects of choleragen on the response of adenylate cyclase to hormones are independent of protein synthesis, and they are not simply a consequence to protracted stimulation of the enzyme in vivo or during preparation of the membranes. activation of cyclase in rat erythrocytes by choleragen is not impaired by agents which disrupt microtubules or microfilaments, and it is still observed in cultured fibroblasts after completely suppressing protein synthesis with diphtheria toxin. choleragen does not interact directly with hormone receptor sites. simple occupation of the choleragen binding sites with the analog, choleragenoid, does not lead to any of the biological effects of the toxin.',\n",

[14c]choline was a specific precursor of the three renal phospholipids, phosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidylcholine, and sphingomyelin. the relative distribution of the label did not change with growth induced by potassium depletion. the results indicate that potassium depletion induces early increases in the formation of cell membrane phospholipid which correlate with specific morphologic changes in different zones within the kidney.',\n",

       " 'the australian journal of experimental biology and medical science. daily administration of increasing doses intraperitoneally of 2.5-4.0 mg nacn/kg to male wistar rats for 5 weeks produced acute signs of poisoning immediately post-injection but no sign of chronic toxicity except lower final body weights than in control rats. cn-treated rats had less liver copper than controls, but not below the range of normality, and their liver mitochondrial membranes were 24% less able to bind adenine nucleotides than control membranes. no other biochemical or pathological sign of copper deficiency occurred. liver cytochrome oxidase activity was normal after the 5 weeks of cn-administration, as was the ability of liver mitochondria to synthesize phospholipids. the ultrastructure of hepatocytes was normal without evidence of the enlarged, misshapen mitochondria produced by copper deficiency. normal cytochrome oxidase activity of liver mitochondria, together with reduced liver copper levels and reduced binding affinity of mitochondrial membranes for adenine nucleotides, indicate that the membrane binding site for adenine nucleotides is not cytochrome oxidase per se but may involve copper, perhaps by virtue of its cationicity. with repeated exposure to cn- rats develop tolerance to acute poisoning. it is suggested that this may be due to the switch in glucose catabolism towards the pentose pathway at the expense of other pathways.',\n",

       " 'biochemistry. prenyltransferase (farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase) was purified from avian liver and characterized by sephadex and sodium dodecyl sulfate gel chromatography, peptide mapping, and end-group analysis. the enzyme is 85 800 +/- 4280 daltons and consists of two identical subunits as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis, peptide mapping, and end-group analysis. chemical analysis of the protein revealed no lipid or carbohydrate components. avian prenyltransferase synthesizes farnesyl pyrophosphate from either dimethylallyl or geranyl pyrophosphate and isopentenyl pyrophosphate. a lower rate of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthesis from farnesyl pyrophosphate and isopentenyl pyrophosphate was also demonstrated. michaelis constants for farnesyl pyrophosphate synthesis are 0.5 mum for both isopentenyl pyrophosphate and geranyl pyrophosphate. the v max for the reaction is 1990 nmol min-1 mg-1 (170 mol min-1 mol-1 enzyme). substrate inhibition by isopentenyl pyrophosphate is evident at high isopentenyl pyrophosphate and low geranyl pyrophosphate concentrations. michaelis constants for geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthesis are 9 mum for farnesyl pyrophosphate and 20 mum for isopentenyl pyrophosphate. the vmax is 16 nmol min-1 mg-1 (1.4 mol min-1 mol-1 enzyme). two moles of each of the allylic substrates is bound per mol of enzyme. the apparent dissociation constants for dimethylallyl, geranyl, and farnesyl pyrophosphates are 1.8, 0.17, and 0.73 mum, respectively. dimethylallyl and geranyl pyrophosphates bound competitively to prenyltransferase with one-for-one displacement. four moles of isopentenyl pyrophosphate was bound per mole of enzyme. citronellyl pyrophosphate, an analogue of geranyl pyrophosphate, was competitive with the binding of 2 of the 4 mol of isopentenyl pyrophosphate bound. the data are interpreted to indicate that each subunit of avian liver prenyltransferase has a single allylic binding site accommodating dimethylallyl, geranyl, and farnesyl pyrophosphates, and one binding site for isopentenyl pyrophosphate. in the absence of an allylic pyrophosphate or analogue, isopentenyl pyrophosphate also can bind to the allylic site.',\n",
       " 'biochimica et biophysica acta. growth temperature-induced compositional changes in membranes of fusarium oxysporum provided a test system for study of the relationship between physical properties and composition. growth at 15 degrees c was characterized by a decrease in phospholipid content relative to sterol content, a shift in phospholipid composition from phosphatidylcholine to phosphatidylethanolamine and a marked enhancement in the amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the phospholipid and triglyceride classes. uptake of a spin labelled analog of stearic acid during growth and subsequent solution of the probe in the membranes allowed estimation of viscosity and molecular order of the membranes of live cells and of isolated membrane preparations. less than 1/20 of the intracellular label was accessible to sodium ascorbate while none was released by sodium dodecyl sulfate. all of the label in live cells was reduced by in vivo respiratory activity above 20 degrees c but this process could be reversed or avoided by added ferricyanide. a cholestane spin probe was also incorporated into the membranes. the probes were not reduced as readily in isolated membranes and hence fluidity of the membranes could be assessed over a wide temperature range. at low temperatures (-10 degrees c) a nonlethal, liquid-solid phase transition was indicated in isolated membrane lipids while at higher (lethal) temperatures (40-45 degrees c), discontinuities appeared in arrhenius plots of rotational correlation time. activation energies for isotropic rotation of the stearate probes in the membranes changed markedly in this temperature range and this effect correlated closely with loss of viability of conidial cells. correlation times for stearate probes showed little variation with growth temperature nor were any breaks in arrhenius plots of this parameter detected in the range 0-35 degrees c in whole cells or isolated membranes. the data indicated control of membrane physical properties within close tolerances throughout the physiological temperature range regardless of growth temperature. it was concluded that this homeostatic phenomenon was due to the counteractive effects of sterol/phospholipid ratio, phospholipid composition and fatty acid polyunsaturation since the condensing and fluidizing components of the isolated total membranes vary in a reciprocal manner.',\n",

       " 'experimental brain research. the possibility that olfactory input is transmitted to specific subregions of the hippocampal formation via the entorhinal cortex was investigated electrophysiologically by analyzing the laminar profiles of potentials evoked in the hippocampal formation by stimulation of the lateral olfactory tract (lot). lot stimulation resulted in long latency (14--20 ms) evoked responses in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation ipsilateral to the stimulation. the variable long latency of these responses and their inability to follow stimulus rates of 40/s suggested that these potentials reflected polysynaptic activation. analysis of the laminar profiles of the evoked potentials indicated that the responses originated from a synaptic field localized in the outer portion of the stratum moleculare of the dentate gyrus, a terminal distribution which overlaps that of the lateral entorhinal cortical (lec) projection to the dentate gyrus. lesions of the lec eliminated the long latency responses in the dentate gyrus evoked by lot stimulation. in addition, a conditioning pulse delivered either to the lot or to the lec produced paired pulse potentiation of the response elicited by subsequent stimulation of the other structure. no evidence was found to indicate that responses were generated in regio superior of the hippocampus proper following lot stimulation. taken together, these results suggest that stimulation of the lot activates the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation by multisynaptic pathways which relay through the lateral portion of the entorhinal area. this finding is discussed with regard to entorhinal cortical organization and the known olfactory projections to the lec.',\n",

       " 'journal of lipid research. the kinetics of endogenously labeled low density lipoprotein (ldl) triglycerides (tg) and apoprotein b (apob) have been studied in four normal and in four hyperlipemic subjects using double tracers. analysis of the data suggests that most ldl triglycerides turn over about 10 times faster than apob (0.003/min vs. 0.0003/min) and that about 10% of the ldl particles contain most of the tg found with ldl. it is not possible to determine from the analysis whether each new ldl particle arrives with the excess tg or whether only a subpopulation of particles contains most of the tg. the kinetic analysis further suggests that triglyceride-rich ldl particles do not exchange with an extraplasma compartment as most ldl particles do, and thus, they behave more like very low density lipoprotein particles. a compartmental model accounting for both the ldl-tg and ldl-apob kinetics is proposed.',\n",

       " 'biochimica et biophysica acta. prolactin receptors were monitored by measuring 125i-labeled prolactin binding to collagenase-dissociated mammary epithelial cells of lactating balb/c mice. specific receptors for iodine-labeled prolactin with an apparent dissociation constant (kd) of 0.99 . 10(-9) m were present on the dissociated mammary cells. the binding was inhibited by ovine prolactin, human growth hormone and human placental lactogen but not by follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, thyroid stimulating hormone, bovine growth hormone or insulin. adrenal ablation of nursing mothers caused a reduction of the number of prolactin receptors and this effect was preventable by hydrocortisone therapy. hydrocortisone injections to mothers 3 days after adrenalectomy also induced a replenishment of the prolactin receptors on the mammary cells. injections of progesterone failed to sustain the high level of mammary cell prolactin receptors in adrenalectomized animals. stimultaneous injections of hydrocortisone and progesterone to animals 3 days after adrenalectomy caused a partial suppression of the stimulatory action of hydrocortisone alone. the results suggest that hydrocortisone can exert a modulatory influence on mammary cell prolactin receptors in non-hypophysectomized post-partum mice without altering the dissociation constant (kd) of the receptors.',\n",

       " 'clinical neurology and neurosurgery. the subcutaneous mean fat-cell volumes as measured in 20 patients suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (als) were definitely larger than those measured in a control group. in contrast with the control subjects, the mean fat-cell volume in patients with als appeared to be independent of body weight. the noted disturbances in carbohydrate-insulin metabolism in patients with als and the increase in serum triglycerides as observed in some patients may be related to the enlarged fat cells. the possibility that the enlargement of the fat-cells may, at least partially, have a neurogenic basis cannot be ignored. the hypothesis is put forward that in patients with als there is not only a lesion of the anterior horn, but also an involvement of sympathic structures responsible for the innervation of adipose tissue vessels. this involvement may lead to an inhibition of the lipolysis, and consequently to an enlargemnt of the fat cell. interaction between the interference with metabolic and neurogenic factors may be at play.',\n",
